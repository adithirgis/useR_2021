# Hello!

My name is Adithi, and I am a Geospatial Data Analyst at ILK Labs in Bangalore, India. This is my first useR! I use R to analyse air quality data. Today, I will present about how I use R and shiny to build tools to provide a workflow to analyse air quality data.

# R in air quality

```{r out.width = "100px", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("WWW/R.png")


```

- R is a powerful tool in analysing air-quality data. 
- With the ever-increasing global measurements of air pollutants (through stationary, mobile, low-cost, and satellite monitoring), the amount of data being collected is huge and necessitates the use of management platforms. 
- In an effort to address this issue, I developed two Shiny applications to analyse and visualise air-quality data.

# pollucheck
```{r out.width = "100px", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("WWW/PolluCheck.png")


```

- It is a simple application / package built using shiny to analyse open-source air quality data.
- The sources from where data can be downloaded and analysed are - [CPCB (specific to India)](https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing), [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org/#/countries/IN?_k=5ecycz), and
[AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/international/us-embassies-and-consulates/#India).
