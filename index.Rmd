# Hello!

My name is Adithi, and I am a Geospatial Data Analyst at ILK Labs in Bangalore, India. This is my first useR! I use R to analyse air quality data. Today, I will present about how I use R and shiny to build tools to provide workflow analyse air quality data.

# R in air quality

```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width = "10%", eval = TRUE}
myimages<-list.files("WWW/", pattern = ".png", full.names = TRUE)
knitr::include_graphics(myimages)

```

R is a powerful tool in analysing air-quality data. With the ever-increasing global measurements of air pollutants (through stationary, mobile, low-cost, and satellite monitoring), the amount of data being collected is huge and necessitates the use of management platforms. In an effort to address this issue, I developed two Shiny applications to analyse and visualise air-quality data.
